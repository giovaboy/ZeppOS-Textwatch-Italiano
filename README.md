# TextWatch — the time, in words

A ZeppOS watchface that tells the time as written words, in your language.

Born as an Italian-only text watch, it now speaks **Italian, English, Spanish, French and Russian** — the language is picked automatically from the watch system language (English is the fallback, including for languages not yet supported, like Turkish).

| Language | Example (14:57) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 🇮🇹 Italiano | `due` / `e cinquantasette` |
| 🇬🇧 English  | `two` / `fifty-seven` |
| 🇪🇸 Español  | `dos` / `y cincuenta y siete` |
| 🇫🇷 Français | `deux` / `et cinquante-sept` |
| 🇷🇺 Русский  | `два` / `и пятьдесят семь` |

Each language gets proper idiomatic forms, not literal translations: `mezzogiorno`/`noon`/`mediodía`/`midi`/`полдень`, quarter hours (`e un quarto`, `y media`, `et quart`, `и четверть`…), Italian phonetic elisions (`ventotto`, `trentuno`), French's non-hyphenated "et un" (`vingt et un`, not `vingt-un`), Russian genitive months in dates.

Russian text renders in [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) instead of the watch's default Barlow font, which has no Cyrillic glyphs — bundled as a Latin+Cyrillic subset to keep the package small.

## Features

- **Time as words** — hours and minutes spelled out, with a smooth slide-in animation on every minute change
- **Localized date** — e.g. `venerdì 26 gennaio`, tap it to open the calendar
- **Always-on display** — dedicated thin-font layout
- **11 backgrounds** — 6 dark + 5 light, selectable in the watchface editor; widget text automatically switches to dark on light backgrounds
- **Per-zone colors** — hour, minute and date colors are independently customizable, with live localized previews in the editor, rendered at the same font size shown on the watch face
- **5 widget slots** — 4 on the bottom row + 1 top-center, each configurable from ~28 data widgets (or left empty); non-empty bottom slots re-space themselves automatically
- **Tap-to-open** — every widget opens its system app (heart rate, weather, alarm…)

### Available widgets

Heart rate, steps, calories, battery, distance, standing hours, PAI (daily arc or weekly bar chart), SpO2, stress, sleep, body/ambient temperature, weather, humidity, wind (speed + direction), UV index, moon phase, sun arc (sunrise/sunset with day-progress dial), BioCharge, VO2max, recovery time, training load, fat burn, altimeter, altitude, stopwatch, countdown, alarm.

## Supported devices
